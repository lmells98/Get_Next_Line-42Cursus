# Get_Next_Line-42

The project get_next_line, we are given the task to create a function that returns a new line read from a file descriptor. The bonus for this task seems intimidating at first. Funnily enough, trying to tackle the bonus part helped me in gaining an understanding on how the function operates logically.

I have submitted both mandatory and bonus parts for evaluation and grading. I will post results when I recieve them!
